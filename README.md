This application is to demonstrate how to use OAuth to authenticate a user
and get the authorisation token to access another resource (google drive) which
is outside of the environment where the application is hosted at

dependancies can be installed with the following command

pip install flask google-api-python-client httplib2

for the application to be able to access the google API, a set of credentials
need to be generated by going to the following URL

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials

go to "Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID" and select "Web application"
option from the list available. Type in a meaningful name in the "Name" field
and click on create. once the client id is created, download it as a json file
and place in the same folder where the assignment2.py file is and rename it to
credentials.json.

then run the project with the following command and navigate to
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ using your browser.

python assignment2.py

this will prompt for your google login and then prompt requesting access to the
google drive; once provided, list out the first 20 files from your google
drive
